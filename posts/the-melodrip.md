# 멜로드립

## 멜로드립이 뭔데?

멜로드립 처음 듣는 사람이라면 멜로드립은 몇 년 전에 나온 커피도구예요. 멜로드립은 샤워스크린과 유리 막대기 세트예요. 휘젓 줄이기 위해 커피가루에 바로 물을 붓는 대신 물을 먼저 샤워스트린을 통해 부어요. 

제가 몇일전에 멜로드립을 선물로 받아서 블로그포스트를 쓰는 것을 좋을 것 같다고 생각했어요. 

제가 이 포스트를 쓸 때 공식사이트에서 멜로드립세트는 $35(₩40,000)에 소매되고 있어요.
## 어떻게 쓰나요?

쓰는 법은 되게 간단해요. 투입한 커피가루 3배 물을 뜸들이면서 막대기로 커피가루를 저어요. 30초 뒤에 물을 총 60ml를 부어요 (20ml를 3번 부어 주세요). 다시 막대기로 커피 슬러리를 저어요. 그다음에 원하는 커피양 나올 때까지 계속 20ml 물을 부어요.  

## 나의 (첫) 경험

처음 사용했을 때 저의 평소 브루잉법으로 사용했어요. 저의 평소 쓰는 법은 하리오V60를 사용하고 커피 30g, 물 500ml, 50ml 뜸들하고 (30초 동안), 150ml 3번 물 투입해요 (브루잉 시간 2분30초 ~ 3분 쯤).  아마도 중요하지 않지만 뜸들할 때 물이 더 많아 보였어요. 그냥 제 추측인데 물이 거칠게 들어가지 않기 때문에 커피 위에 좀 모인 것 같아요. 그리고 남은 물을 투입했을 때 좀 빨른 편이었어요. 또 그냥 제 추측인데 아마도 완전 가늘한 커피가루는 (fines) 안 내려갈 것 같아서 물이 잘 통했어요. 

과연 이 커피의 맛은 어땠을까? 그냥 뭐 맛있었어요. 사용한 커피원두는 브라질 캄포다스베르텐테스 옐로우 카투아이 무산소내쳐럴이에요. 달콤하고 컵노트를 잘 느꼈어요.

그다음에 제가 다른 원두로 한 잔 더 내렸어요. 이 커피는 파나마 라 에스메렐다 다이몬드 마운틴 내쳐럴 카투아이예요. 이 커피는 원래 좀 따뜻한 느낌을 가지고 있어요. 초콜릿, 마른 과일, 브라운슈가 같은 맛이에요. 하지만 멜로드립으로 내릴 때 단맛이 너무 강해요. 그냥 설탕 같은 단맛이 났어요. 그리고 식힐 때 산미는 평소 보다 많이 났어요. 

그래서 전체적으로 맛은 좀 달라졌어요. 그것은 좋거나 안 좋거나 솔직히 제가 잘 모르겠어요. 왜냐하면 사람의 입맛에 따라서 다를 수 있겠죠? 하지만 당연히 테스트 좀 해야 하죠.

## 삼각테스트

원래 첫 테스트는 굴절기로 TDS나 추출수율을 봐야 하는데 저는 굴절기가 없어서 그런 테스트 못 해요. 그래서 삼각테스트를 해봤어요. 핸드드립 2잔을 내렸어요. 하나는 저의 평소 쓴 법으로 했고 하나는 멜로드립의 추천한 법으로 내렸어요. 멜로드립의 맛(?)을 찾기 위해서 평소스타일 커피를 2샘플을 했고 멜로드립 커피를 한 샘플을 했어요. 블라인드로 하기 위해 저희 와이프는 잔을 섞었어요. 

결국엔 멜로드립 커피를 성공하게 찾았어요. 하지만 생각보다 쉽지 않았어요. 처음에 틀렸어요. 커피 좀 식혔을 때 맛 차이 좀 더 났어요. 평소스타일 커피가 쓴 맛이 좀 났고 멜로드립 커피가 좀 더 산미를 잘 느끼고 부드러웠어요.

## 결과엔?

왜 이런 결과가 나왔는지 솔직히 잘 모르겠어요. 저는 그 정도 전문성이 없어서 추측 안 할 거예요 ^^ 하지만 멜로드립을 구입해서 사용할 가치가 있는 도구인지 의견을 나누는 것도 괜찮을 것 같아요. 

일단 맛 차이가 작은 편이에요. 아마도 커피와 관련된 일 하는 사람들한테 그 맛 차이 느낄 수 있을 것 같아요. 홈바리스타 같은 사람들도 느낄 수 있어요. 하지만 그냥 '보통' 커피를 마시는 사람들은 아마도 못 느낄 것 같아요. 특히 나란히 비교 안 해요. 

이제 멜로드립 좀 사용해서 제 생각은 멜로드립을 자주 안 쓰는데 가끔 그냥 재미로 쓸 것 같아요. 지금 제가 멜로드립 쓸 때 약간 귀찮은 느낌이 나요. 더 많이 집중해야 해서 그래요. 그리고 저는 잘 쓰는 브루잉 스타일 가지고 있어서 그렇게 하면 더 편해요. 

## 누구한테 멜로드립을 추천?

저랑 안 맞을 것 같지만 잘 맞는 사람이겠죠? 그래서 어떤 사람한테 추천할까요? 일단 구스넥 케틀 없는 사람한테 추천해요. 그냥 케틀 쓰면 컨트롤 좀 어려니까 멜로드립 샤워스크린 쓰면 도움이 될 수 있어요. 그리고 여행 가끔 가는 사람들도 추천해요. 이유는 똑 같아요. 제가 떠오른 생각은 명절에 저희 장모님의 댁에 갔을 때 그냥 케틀을 있어서 핸드드립 같은 커피를 좀 어려웠어요. 

그리고 좀 더 일관된 커피 루틴을 만들고 싶은 사람한테 추천해요. 조금씩 조금씩 물을 부니까 루틴 잘 만들 수 있을 것 같아요. 맞는 그라인드사이즈를 찾고 샤워스크린을 사용하는 것을 익숙해지면 잘 쓸 수 있을 것 같아요.

마지막으로 좀 다크한 로스팅 된 커피를 사용한 사람한테도 추천해요. 제가 쓸 때 그 살짝 쓴한 맛이 제거 할 수 있어서 다크 커피랑 잘 어울릴 것 같아요.

# The Melodrip

## What's the Melodrip?

So if you haven't heard of it, the Melodrip came out several years back, but I just got gifted one a week ago, so I thought I'd write about my initial experiences with it. The Melodrip is a small shower screen type device (attached a metal handle) and glass stir stick that is used to control things like agitation, water distribution, saturation, etc. when doing a pour over coffee. As of writing, you can purchase the Melodrip set from the official website (see link below) for $35.

## How does it work?

The idea is actually simple enough. Basically you use the stir stick to help break up any clumps of coffee and ensure even saturation and the shower screen head to more evenly distribute water and reduce agitation when pouring. 

## How to brew

So, this is just what is included on the official Melodrip website, but the idea is basically you pour several small pours (20ml or so) every 10 seconds until reaching your desired brew amount. By doing smaller pours you can more evenly distribute water and there's less chance of agitation. 

The full(er) method is rinse the paper, grind and dose your coffee, and use the stir stick to distribute in the filter (using the circular swirl motion - sorry I forget the name of this technique). Then do a 3x bloom as normal and stir with the stick. Pour three 20ml pours through the screen (low to the bed). Each pour should bring the water just above the coffee bed and the subsequent pour should be when the water has drained out. After the third pour, stir again. Repeat this pouring process (minus the stir) until the desired brew amount is reached (the basic recipe is 18 grams coffee and 360ml water).

## My experience

For my first brew I decided to just see how it worked if I poured 'normally'. My normal brew is a 30g coffee to 500ml of water, a 50ml bloom, and three equal 150ml pours (with a final swirl) using a Hario V60. While not important, when pouring the bloom the amount of water *looked* like a lot more than usual. I imagine this is because the 'weaker' pour causes the initial water going in to penetrate the bed more slowly than a regular kettle pour, so it accumulates a bit more on the top of the bed before starting to filter through. For the remaining pours, the brew seemed a bit on the quicker side. Again, I imagine that maybe the lower agitation of the pours caused less fines migration down to the bottom? The taste of this brew was fine, it was perfectly good.

I used the Melodrip a second time with a different coffee and it also came out okay. It was very sweet, but a bit lacking I felt in some of the other characteristics I typically get from that coffee. This coffee - a Panama La Esmeralda Diamond Mountain natural Catuai - usually has some 'warmer' cup characteristics. A slight chocolatey, dried fruit, warm sweetness? But, this cup had an almost sugary sweetness. It was bright. As it cooled it developed a much stronger acidity than it normally does. 

A little bit mixed from a pure tasting standpoint. I wouldn't say it made the coffee 'worse' per se but it certainly seemed to make it taste different. So, the next step is of course to do some kind of test.

## Triangle testing the Melodrip

Probably the first test would be something like using a refractometer to test the TDS/extraction levels. However I don't have a refractometer so that was out. A check online showed mixed results for how the Melodrip affected TDS. Some showed an increase, others a decrease. 

So, what I ended up doing was just a simple triangle test. Two brews, one following the Melodrip's recommended method and one using my traditional method. I used Melodrip's recommended serving which again is 18g coffee and 360ml water. I brewed first using my trad method (60g bloom, three 100ml pours) and it took about 3 minutes to finish. Then I brewed the Melodrip method and it took about 2:40 to finish. I decided to check if the Melodrip coffee was easier to pick out so it was two cups of the trad brew and one cup. My wife mixed the cups to make it semi-blind at least. 

Jumping to the end, I was able to pick out the Melodrip brew. However, it did take a couple rounds of tasting to find it. On the first tasting, my initial reaction turned out to a one of the traditional brews. But as the coffee cooled down a bit the two brews started to show some different characteristics. The traditional brews started to have a slight bitter finish to them (the original coffee wasn't dark by any stretch, but a little on the more developed side of things). The Melodrip brew retained a bit more acidity to it and felt a tad smoother in terms of body and finish.

## Dissecting the results

Now, I don't really want to speculate why the results tasted different because I'm not an expert enough to really dig through and analyze it. But, I do think it's worth discussing the fact that they did taste a bit different and trying to apply that to whether the Melodrip is worthy of A) acquiring and B) actually incorporating into one's coffee brewing routine.

The difference in taste was slight. To coffee professionals or coffee enthusiasts who are used to trying to pick through what they're tasting, that difference may be significant to them. However, my guess would be that to the 'average' coffee drinker - especially if they are not comparison tasting - that difference would be enough to really alter how they perceive the coffee they're drinking.

My initial reaction after brewing with it a couple times is that it's a bit extra. Like, I think you could adjust and get used to brewing with it and probably get some really tasty stuff out of it. But, if you already have a brewing routine that you are satisfied with then I don't know if it's worth changing. My initial gut reaction to the Melodrip is that I may occasionally pull it out to play with, but it likely will not become a mainstay of my daily brew routine. There's something about the constant little pours and holding the screen while pouring that's just a little annoying. 

## Who might like the Melodrip?

While I don't think the Melodrip is for me, some people may enjoy using it. 

People who may not have a gooseneck kettle may benefit from having a Melodrip to help control the pour and flow of the water from a 'regular' kettle.

If you travel and can't take a gooseneck with you and still want to do pour overs then (as long as you can keep it from breaking in your luggage) this could be a useful tool to help. I think of when I lived in Korea and would travel to visit my mother-in-law's for the holidays. She only had a regular hot water kettle, and this could have made brewing pour overs better/a bit easier. 

People who would rather have a tool to help them with brewing consistency may also like the Melodrip. Pouring through the screen does help control the flow and distribution of water that otherwise needs to be done through control of the kettle. If that's something that one struggles with or just would rather entrust to something else, then maybe give the Melodrip a look.

Finally, I would recommend the Melodrip to people who regularly use darker roast coffee and would like to take a little of the bitterness off. I found that when used with slightly darker roasts some of that bitter finish was removed when brewing with the Melodrip.
