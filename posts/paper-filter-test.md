# 종이필터를 린싱을 하나요?

유튜브나 온라인 아니면 커피프로한테 물어보면 그 대답은 'Yes'라고 해요. 몇 년전에 핸드드립을 처음 시작했을 때 이 조언(?)을 듣고 그냥 '뭐 말이 된다'고 생각해서 그냥 그렇게 했어요. 하지만 최근에 그런 '커피의 사실'을 확인하고 싶어서 작은 실험을 했어요.

## 이유

필터를 린싱하는 이유는 안 하면 필터를 통해 내리는 커피에서 종이 맛이 날 거예요. 갈색 종이필터를 쓰면 더 심한 종이 맛이 날 거예요. 안타깝게(?) 저는 갈색 종이필터가 없어서 확인 못 했어요. 그리고 솔직히 이 미니 실험하기 전에 저는 필터를 통해 나온 커피가 당연히 어느 정도 종이 맛이 나겠다고 생각했어요.  종이 맛이 얼마나 나올까요? 린싱한 필터와 린싱 안 한 필터의 커피 맛이 큰 차이가 있을까요?

## 1번 실험

첫 실험은 종이필터를 물에 적시면 종이 맛이 얼마나 날까요? 실험은 하리오 V60필터와 칼리타웨이브 필터를 4분 동안 뜨거운 물에 담궜어요. 그리고 한 컵에 그냥 뜨거운 물을 넣었어요 (나중에 온도가 다 비슷하기 위해). 4분 후에 종이필터를 버리고 각 (반)삼각 시험법을 했어요. 작은 컵 3개를 준비했어요. 한 작은 컵에  종이 물을 넣고 다른 두 작은 컵에 그냥 뜨거운 물을 넣었어요. *컵에 물을 넣은 뒤에 컵 순서를 바꿨어요*.

## 1번 실험 결과

일단 저는 테이스팅 전문가 아니라고 생각해요. 그리고 저는 원래 좋은 미각을 가지고 있지 않아요. 그래서 이 결과가 '일반 커피 소비자'한테 도움이 될 것 같아요. 아마도 연습 많이 했던 커피 전문가는 맛 차이가 좀 더 크게 느낄 수 있어요.

첫 라운드는 칼리타웨이브 필터였어요. 종이물을 찾는 것이 좀 쉬웠어요. 하지만 제가 상상했던 맛 차이와 달랐어요. 제가 상상했던 것은 적신 종이필터 물은 좀 *더* 진한 맛일 줄 알았어요. 약간 종이 같은 맛이나 이상한 오염시키는 맛이에요. 하지만 실제로 제가 느끼는 맛은 좀 반대였어요. 첫 두 컵 맛보기 뒤에  1번 컵이 2번 컵보다 바디감 좀 더 있고 맛이 좀 더 있기 때문이에요. 하지만 그다음에 3번 컵 맛봤어요. 3번 컵은 1번 컵과 비슷했어요. 그래서 저는 잠깐 헷갈렸어요. 하지만 한번 더 맛보고 확실했어요. 2번 컵은 달랐어요. 

2번 라운드는 똑 같았는데 하리오 V60 필터를 사용했어요. 이 라운드는 1번 라운드보다 어려웠어요. 종이맛 물 찾기 첫 시도에서 실패했어요 ㅜㅜ 하지만 2번 시도에서 성공하게 찾았어요. V60 필터는 웨이브 필터보다 종이 맛이 덜 나요.

## 2번 실험

1번 실험의 결과를 보면서 종이 필터를 린싱하지 않으면 어느 정도 종이 맛이 있다고 할 것 같아요. 하지만 1번 실험에 물만 쓰는 실험이었어요. 커피를 내리면 그 종이 맛이 그대로 느낄 수 있을까요? 당연히 커피가 물보다 맛이 강해서 어느 정도 종이 맛을 느낄 수 있을까요? 그리고 느낄 수 있으면 꼭 린싱해야 하는 만큼인가요? 그것은 2번 실험의 목표이었어요.

2번 실험의 과정은 1번 실험과 비슷했어요. 커피 2잔을 내렸어요.  똑 같은 원두 (써드 코스트 커피의 에티오피아 예가체프), 드립어 (애프릴 브루어), 원두/물 양 (15g 커피, 250g 물), 물 온도 (98C), 브루잉 레시피를 사용했어요. 브루잉 레시피는 안치훈 바리스타님의 유튜브 채널에서 봤던 파이브브루잉 도현수 바리스타님의 칼리타웨이브 레시피를 사용했어요. 왜냐면 너무 간단하니까 쉽게 반복할 수 있었어요. 그냥 뜸 들이기하다가 한 푸어하고 끝났어요. 

## 2번 실험 결과

2번 실험은 칼리타웨이브만 사용했어요. 왜냐하면 1번 실험에서 칼리타웨이브 필터는 더 강한 종이 맛이 났어요. 1번 실험처럼 한 잔에 종이필터 린싱 안 한 커피를 넣고 다른 두 잔에 종이 필터 린싱 한 커피를 넣었어요. 

그리고 1번 실험처럼 종이 필터 린싱 안 한 커피를 쉽게 찾았어요. 맛은 1번 실험과 비슷했어요. 좀 밋밋했어요.

## 결과물 분석 

그래서 이 두 작은 실험에서 배운게 있나요? 네 있을 것 같아요.

일단 저는 개인적으로 계속 종이 필터를 린싱할 거예요. 왜냐하면 종이 맛은 제가 예상한 것이 아니었어요. 제가 예상했던 것은 종이 필터 때문에 커피 맛이 좀 더 더티한데 실제로 커피 맛이 좀 밋밋했어요. 그래서 저 같은 경우는 이 것때문에 린싱을 계속할 거예요.

하지만 생각보다 종이 맛은 많이 나지 않았어요. 나란히 맛봐서 차이를 잘 느낄 수 있었지만 그냥 하나만 마시면 알 수 있을까요? 종이 필터 린싱 안 하는 커피가 괜찮았어요. 맛있었고 편하게 마셨어요. 그래서 문제는 커피에 린싱 단계가 없다는 것을 안다면 편하게 마실 수 있을까요? 저 같은 경우는 답은 아니요. 그래서 저는 계속 종이 필터를 린싱할 거예요. 하지만 아마도 다른 사람들의 답은 네라고 할 것 같아요. 

추천 방법은 만약 집에서나 카페에서 커피를 내릴때 린싱했으면 좋겠어요. 왜냐하면 커피의 가장 베스트 버전을 할 수 있어요. 그리고 린싱하면서 드립어, 컵, 등도 가열 할 수 있어요. 린싱이 필요없는 경우는 물이 많이 없을 때에요. 예를 들어 캠핑이나 소풍 갈 때요. 이런 상황에서 그냥 편하게 린싱 안 하고 커피를 마셔요.

# Do You Need to Rinse Your Filter?

Looking around YouTube, coffee professionals, and online the general consensus seems to be "yes, you should definitely rinse your filter before using it". This is something that I've just kind of taken as gospel. When I started doing pour over coffees a several years back, I just heard this and it made sense so I just did it. However, recently I've started to become more skeptical/curious about some of these gospel things that you hear about coffee. So, I decided to try and check some of the things that I can check out easily.

## The Reason

The supposed reason for rinsing the filter is that if you don't, the coffee will be tainted by a papery taste. The taint is supposedly stronger if you use an unbleached brown filter. Unfortunately(?) I didn't have any unbleached filters, so I could not test this one. When thinking about it, this reasoning seems very plausible. And to be honest, before doing this mini-experiment I did not doubt that unrinsed filters would have some impact on the resulting coffee. My doubt was that the impact would be sufficiently significant to warrant the need to rinse. So, that's what I was exploring. Does using an unwashed filter significantly affect the taste of the resulting brewed coffee?
![Paper Filter Water 5](/images/paper-filter/paper-filter7.jpg "Coffees brewed with rinsed and unrinsed filters")
## Experiment #1 Set Up

The initial experiment was just to see how much a paper filter affected the taste. So, I just steeped a Hario V60 filter (with tab in the vinyl pack) and a Kalita Wave filter (185) in some hot water (98C) for 4 minutes (cupping time). I also poured a coup of just plain hot water into a cup as well so the temperature for all three would be similar. After 4 minutes I threw away the paper filters and did a half-blind triangle test with both the Kalita and Hario filter. The triangle test was I had three smaller cups. In one cup I put the paper water and in the other two cups I put the regular water. So the test was to see if I could pick out the paper water. *After pouring the water in the smaller cups, the cups were switched around so I didn't know which cup was which.*

## Experiment #1 Result

Some background. First off, just to set a reference I would not consider myself an expert taster nor would I consider myself to have a naturally sensitive palate. So, I think these results - while highly unscientific - are still potentially useful to 'regular' coffee drinkers. And again, that was sort of the point of this test. I imagine to people who are either highly trained/practiced coffee tasters, the difference in taste will be more pronounced and significant. 

The first round was using the Kalita Wave filter. I actually found this round to be fairly easy to find the paper water. However, I was slightly surprised by what I perceived to be the difference. I had expected the paper water to taste *more* of something. More papery, to have a kind of strange taint to the water. But in reality - at least to my tastes - it felt kind of the opposite. After tasting the first two cups, I thought I had instantly recognized the paper water because the first cup had a slightly fuller feel and 'tasted' more than the second cup did. So, I assumed that the first cup was the paper water. However, I then tasted the third cup and it tasted more like the first cup. Which threw me for a moment. But, after the second pass of tasting I did feel pretty confident that the second cup was the paper water cup being the odd one out, and I was correct.

The second round was the same but using the Hario V60 filter. This round was more difficult than the first round. And I actually was incorrect on the first pass. I did manage to get it on the second pass. But I would definitely say that the Hario V60 paper gives off noticeably less paper feel/taste than the Wave filter.

## Moving to Experiment #2

So, I think it's fair to say that yes, not rinsing the filter does give off a taint. However, when combined with coffee, is that taint A) strong enough to noticeably affect the flavor, and B) is the result noticeable enough to warrant the extra water and time/effort needed to rinse the filter? That was the hope for experiment #2.

So, the process was similar to experiment #1. I brewed two cups using the same coffee (Ethiopia Yirgacheffe from Third Coast Coffee), same dripper (April Brewer), same ratio (15g coffee, 250g water), and same temperature (98C). The brewing technique I used I saw on Ahn Chi-hoon's YouTube channel (안스타) when he brewed coffee with 5Brewing's Do Hyun-soo. I decided to use this technique because it was extremely simple. It was a quick bloom followed by a single pour and draw down. So 40g bloom (30 seconds) and then pouring up to 250g (it took until 1:05 to pour and the draw down finished at 2:15).

## Experiment #2 Results

I only did this experiment once with the Kalita Wave. I did the Wave because it had the more pronounced paper flavor in the first test. Again, after brewing both coffees the one that was brewed with the unrinsed filter was put in one cup and the coffee brewed with a rinsed filter was put into the other two cups. 

Similar to the first experiment with the Kalita Wave I was able to discern the unrinsed filter coffee. And it did present in a similar manner to the plain water and filter experiment. The coffee that was brewed with the unrinsed filter had a slightly flatter feel to it.

## Dissecting the Results

So, is there any lesson to take from this little test? I think so. 

The first thing I'll say is I will continue to rinse the paper filter before brewing coffee. The reason is acutally because the 'paper taint' did not present as I had expected. I had expected it to make the coffee feel 'dirty' but it actually seemed to make it flatter and like the paper kind of 'took' from the coffee rather then adding something. For me, this was enough to convince me that not rinsing the paper would deprive me of some of that coffee's flavor and characteristics.

However, the second thing I'll say is that the effect was smaller than I had expected. Doing the tasting side-by-side, it was noticeable, but if you just drank it on it's own... then maybe you wouldn't really notice the difference? The coffee that came from the unrinsed filter was not bad by any means. It was tasty and perfectly drinkable. The question is, knowing that you are missing something - however small that something may be - is that enough to get someone to rinse the filter if they aren't already? As mentioned before, for me, that answer is yes I will continue to rinse. For other people though, that answer may very well be no.

If I had to come to a more exact conclusion, I would say this. If you're at home (or working at a cafe), then I would recommend rinsing the filter just to ensure that you are getting the best from the coffee you've purchased (or are selling). There is also the benefit of pre-heating the dripper/server/cup when you rinse. However, if you are in some position where water is scarce (like going camping or hiking) then I would say don't bother rinsing and don't worry that the resulting coffee will be 'bad'.
